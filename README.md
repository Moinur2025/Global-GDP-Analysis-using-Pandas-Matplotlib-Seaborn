# 🌍 Global GDP Analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on **GDP per capita** data from different countries using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 📂 Dataset Source
The dataset contains GDP per capita values for various countries.  
> **Note:** Figures do **not account** for cost of living differences between countries.  
> GDP per capita is **not a direct measure** of personal income or standard of living.  
> PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) is often used to improve comparisons, but it still has limitations.

## 🧠 Objective
- Explore global GDP trends
- Visualize GDP distribution across countries
- Understand the limitations of using GDP per capita as a development metric
- Learn data analysis and visualization using Python

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data loading, cleaning, manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – Basic visualizations
- **Seaborn** – Enhanced, statistical visualizations

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Bar plots and box plots of GDP per capita by country
- Histogram of GDP distribution
- Trendline of GDP changes over time (if time series data exists)
- PPP vs Nominal GDP comparisons (if available)
